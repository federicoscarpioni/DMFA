# Dynamic Multi-Frequency Analysis
This repository contains the software tools to make a Dynamic Electrochemical Impednace Spectroscopy (DEIS) experiment and extract the impedance through the Dynamic Multi-Frequency Analysis (DMFA). A script is provided for the sampling of data with a PicoTech Piscope series 4000 and a module (dmfa.py) contains the necessary functions for the extraction.

Data file to test the DMFA procedure are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21082168.v1

An example of use is provided at the end of the dmfa.py module
